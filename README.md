Project Summary: A Study on Card Shuffling via Simulations

This project investigates the fairness and randomness of card shuffling techniques, a topic of long-standing interest in statistics and gaming. Since the integrity of shuffling directly impacts the fairness of both casual and competitive card games, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of three traditional methods: riffle shuffle, overhand shuffle, and pile shuffle.

Using simulations, mathematical modelling, and statistical analysis, we evaluated and compared the degree of randomization achieved by each method, highlighting their respective strengths and limitations. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the balance between practical shuffling techniques and the randomness required for fair gameplay.

This study was carried out as a collaborative group project with three peers, combining shared expertise in probability, simulation, and data analysis to deliver robust and meaningful results.
